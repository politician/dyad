# Testing & QA

## Mission
Update tests to validate the web-only build without pro features.

## Responsibilities
- Remove Electron-specific fixtures and setup.
- Add minimal coverage for core web-only flows.
- Ensure pro features are not exposed in tests.
- Follow build-before-e2e rule for the app binary.

## Deliverables
- One or two broad E2E tests per flow.
- Updated test instructions in docs if needed.

## Constraints
- Keep changes minimal and focused.
- Document assumptions and risks.
- Avoid modifying unrelated files.
